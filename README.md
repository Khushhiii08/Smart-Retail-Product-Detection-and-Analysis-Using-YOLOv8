This project aims to develop a smart retail product detection system using computer vision to detect products picked by customers in a retail store environment. The system leverages two YOLOv8 models to detect grocery items, hand, store basket and trolly. By identifying hand-to-product and product-to-store-basket-or-trolly interactions, it can accurately determine which products customers have picked. The solution integrates with a Flask-based web application, allowing users to upload videos or images for product and hand detection. The system processes these inputs in real time, stores the results in a database, and provides actionable insights into customer behaviour.


‚öôÔ∏è Project Modules:
1. User Authentication:
   - Secure login and signup functionality using Flask.  
   - Session management to control access to the dashboard.

2. Product and Hand Detection:  
   - YOLOv8 models trained to detect grocery items and hand.  
   - Detection pipeline processes both images and videos.  
   - Checks if hand overlaps with product bounding boxes to mark products as picked.

3. Data Storage and Management: 
   - Detected product and action data is stored in an SQL database.  
   - Stores customer interactions for further analysis.

4. Web Interface (Flask Dashboard):  
   - Upload videos or images for detection.  
   - View detected products and interactions in a user-friendly interface.  


üß† Technology Stack:
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Models:
    - Grocery Items Detection Model
    - Hand Keypoint Detection Model


üé• Workflow:
1. User Authentication:  
   - Login or Signup to access the system.
   - Access is granted to the dashboard upon successful login.

2. Video/Image Upload:  
   - Upload videos or images via the web interface.
   - Files are processed and stored in the server.

3. Detection and Analysis:  
   - YOLOv8 models detect grocery items and hand.
   - If the box boundary of a hand overlap with a product‚Äôs bounding box, and later that of a product with a store basket or trolly, it is marked as "picked."

4. Data Storage: 
   - Detected actions and product information are stored in a SQLite database.
   - Results are visualized on the dashboard.

5. Report Generation: 
   - Users can view detected products and analyze customer behaviour.


üåê Use Cases:
- Retail stores for smart shelf monitoring.
- Analyzing customer behaviour for product placement optimization.
- Enhancing the shopping experience with real-time product tracking.

Dataset Used:

We initially integrated a dataset we found online with 6000 images of Indian products, manually taken and labelled. Still, the results didn't come out great so we then implemented a small, 936 images, self-built images dataset on our project. We couldn't find any good store CCTV footage online that could be used to train the model with real-world data, so we relied on publicly available images of store items and simulated interactions like picking and placing products in a cart. However, not many relevant images were available online, out of which not all could be used for training, and the quality and compatibility of the chosen images varied significantly, resulting in a limited and inconsistent dataset for training YOLOv8.
